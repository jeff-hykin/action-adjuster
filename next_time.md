Figure out why perfect doesn't get a score of ~0 in the objective function
    - 0 should be possible
        - at each timestep, calculate the equation for the optimal action
    - nothing should beat 0
DONE: Figure out why the solver thread dies
DONE: Figure out why `@ADJUSTER=PERFECT` doesn't get a perfect run
